        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>I've had a habit of reading since last few years and I've grown with it, but since last year, there is something new I've been trying - writing, it's something I've been trying to be more productive. I like fun things like quilling and recently practicing crochet.</p>

            <h3>What skills have you developed since starting your professional course?</h3>
            <p>Since I've started my professional course...I feel there is a major upgrade in my communication skill and teamwork as I've been exposed to several opportunities that'd require them. For example, participating in competition like debate, innovation and skits...and interacting with patients has been the highlight of my upgrade since last year.</p>
